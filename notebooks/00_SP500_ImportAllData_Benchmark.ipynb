    "### \"Time Series Prediction with ANNs on non-linear and non-stationary Time Series\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** Former working title was slightly different: \"Predicting Regime Shifts for non-linear and non-stationary Time Series with Artificial Neural Networks\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Research Questions:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Q0:** Set the benchmark: How do **naive heuristics** perform? Try naive buy&hold strategy, which means being always long. Then the accuracy is supposed to be the relative amount of UP movements. Then - in addition to naive buy&hold - take majority vote of last *k* days movement as predictor for next day. What accuracy do we achieve with that? And do we already outperform the naive buy&hold approach? Get baselines for Train / Validation / Test data seperately for both heuristics and all four targets.\n",
    "- **Q1:** Can we predict trends in stock price movements from their own history alone? (open, high, low, close, range, traded shares, observed volatility, moving averages, RSI, MACD, Bollinger limits) —> We expect to fail and get only poor accuracy (50%). These are all **technical features**.\n",
    "- **Q2:** Do **external features** help improving accuracy? (mostly macroeconomic indices: GDP, inflation expectation, interest rates,...)\n",
    "- **Q3:** If we still get poor results, why and where do our models fail? Do we find similarities in terms of patterns or regimes, in which our model performs better or worse? (e.g. high volatility regime,...) Start with analysing samples with highest loss (deviation of prediction from true target), then apply (subspace-)clustering in input feature space.\n",
    "- **Q4:** And eventually we want to make use of our models and try to set up some trading model, that beats the market (= naive buy-and-hold). Plot cumulative outperformance, cumulative gain from naive buy-and-hold and closing price history (abs values), to recognize, in which market situations our model performs best.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Outline:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we **load data from *csv* file** - preprocessed in EXCEL, including technical AND external features plus targets. **Note:** Start with S&P500 data history at Jan 7th, 1985, since from there on we have all values available. The limiting factor is Baltic Dry Index. Without that we could start in April 1982, since from there on we find open/high/low/close/vol on [Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC). \n",
    "\n",
    "We then tackle **Q0** to **set the benchmark with naive heuristics**."

    "\n",
    "The longer the target horizon, the more likely UP movements become. This is also found in an increased accuracy from our naive buy&hold strategy, hence in an increased relative amount of *positive* target values of 61.8% / 67.2% / 68.3% for train / validation / test data for target 20d.\n",
